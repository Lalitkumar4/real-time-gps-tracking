# Real-Time GPS Tracking

This is a simple React app that uses the [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/) to transform the coordinates into an address that can be understood by users and the Geolocation API to get the user's current location. It also has the ability to continuously track the user's GPS location.

## Usage

```
## Install Dependencies
npm install

## Run dev server :3000
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenCage API key
